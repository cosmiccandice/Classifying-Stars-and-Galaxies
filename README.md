# StarsVsGalaxies

Run the main file in Jupyter Notebook to classify stars and galaxies taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 

#Project Overview 
In this project, data has been taken from a Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Sloan Digital Sky Survey released and processed through machine learning algorithms to classify stars from galaxies. The SDSS is an international collaboration which uses a 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, US. With this telescope, the SDSS creates a multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey which has so far been able to observe over 1 billion objects.
